<h4 align="center">Moodify is a music-driven application designed to enhance your emotional well-being through personalized music recommendations. After setting up your preferences, the app analyzes your emotions using Google ML Kit's facial recognition technology. Based on your detected mood, it suggests music that aligns with your emotional state. The app allows users to browse and search for tracks, follow playlists, and view track details, including artist and genre information. Additionally, it integrates Spotify's API to provide seamless music streaming. Moodify offers a clean, user-friendly interface featuring a dark mode to ensure an enjoyable user experience.</h4>
